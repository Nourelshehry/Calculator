# Calculator
This is our mini calculator project, it’s made to deal with all mathematical operation which we use in our daily life. 
We take an expression from user as a string, and then we deal with all numerical and characters in this expression. 

**The input and output example**:

Firstly, we make a cpp code which deal with all functions that we need, after that we turn every instruction to assembly by help of reference: **assembly language for x86 processors**, which were a really helpful to deal with **jmp**, **cmp** function

**Example of our usage:**

**To make a good understanding about our project:**
>note that: String can’t be held as it is in assembly code, so we made a **“buffer”** which is array of 30 bytes, which held the expression that user entered. 

>note also:The Epb is a (base pointer) register which we use to point to byte by byte in the expression which user enter -Which held in buffer- . 

**Notice also these labels:**

**“Sign”** is represent if the number is positive: represented by 1. Or negative: represented by -1.

**“result”** held the answer of entered expression, after doing all entered operations, so it’s DWord: 4bytes.

**“Co”** only represented by 1 or 2, which indicates that if co is 1, then there’s multiplication operation. 
If it’s 2, so it indicates that there’s a division operation, for that it’s only 2 bytes: a word. 

**“aux”** it’s hold the number after multiplication/division operation. 

**“nr”** is hold the number changes during operation.
