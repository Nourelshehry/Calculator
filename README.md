# Calculator
This is our mini calculator project, it’s made to deal with all mathematical operation which we use in our daily life. 
We take an expression from user as a string, and then we deal with all numerical and characters in this expression. 

**The input and output example**:

Firstly, we make a cpp code which deal with all functions that we need, after that we turn every instruction to assembly by help of reference: **assembly language for x86 processors**, which were a really helpful to deal with **jmp**, **cmp** function

**Example of our usage:**

# To make a good understanding about our project:
>note that: String can’t be held as it is in assembly code, so we made a **“buffer”** which is array of 30 bytes, which held the expression that user entered. 

>note also:The Epb is a (base pointer) register which we use to point to byte by byte in the expression which user enter -Which held in buffer- . 

**Notice these labels:**

**Sign** is represent if the number is positive: represented by 1. Or negative: represented by -1.

**result** held the answer of entered expression, after doing all entered operations, so it’s DWord: 4bytes.

**Co** only represented by 1 or 2, which indicates that if co is 1, then there’s multiplication operation. 
If it’s 2, so it indicates that there’s a division operation, for that it’s only 2 bytes: a word. 

**aux** it’s hold the number after multiplication/division operation. 

**nr** is hold the number changes during operation.

 # Overview:
**In code**:
we use ***start*** to represent the `infinite loop` in which user can use the program to write expression more than one time, by `jmp` to this label at the ***answer*** section at the end of program:
**Entering more than one expression:

***Loop1*** and ***digit*** sections are indicating functions which check the number of digits which entered by user and seperate digit by digit, recognise that in this section we used a special `mov` which is `movzx` to mix size of 32bit register and 16bit register:

after that, we have ***switch*** section in which we check if entered symbol is: '+','-','\*','/' or other.
Depending on the entered symbol we `je` to required label: ***addition***, ***substraction***, ***multiplication*** or ***Division***
There's also ***psign*** and ***nsign*** labels which indicates positive and negative sign.
in ***incre*** we only increment the value of **Ebp** register by one to move to next digit.
finally, in ***answer*** section we `mov` the final value to the result and show it and return to begin to retry all the program again to make user able to write many expressions as he wanted.
